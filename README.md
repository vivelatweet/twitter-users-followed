## Description
Vive La Tweet preserves and maintains a record of tweets by political figures so that they are never lost from the public domain. This small but important action helps protect the most important constituency in a democracy: the governed.

The CSV files saved in this repository indicate the Twitter users whose tweets are currently being archived.

## Contributing a new list of Twitter users
If you would like to suggest a new list of Twitter users to archive, register a GitHub account and click the "Create new file" link [on this page](https://github.com/vivelatweet/twitter-users-followed). Alternatively, simply email a text file to hello@ViveLaTweet.com with a list of user accounts to follow.

## File format
The format of a user file is comma-separated values (CSV). **The value after the last comma must indicate the Twitter account of the user.**

The values before the last comma should be consistent across the entire file. An entire line usually resembles something like this format:

```
  Jurisdiction,Last Name,First Name,Twitter Account
```
  
Each line need not have the same number of commas - the site's parser only looks at the value after the last comma. The other fields simply help to keep the file organized so that a human can be easily update the list in the future.

## What user lists are eligible?
Vive La Tweet is focused on archiving the political speech of political figures. The site is not restricted to speech from any specific physical region or system of government. As such, we welcome any user list comprised of political figures from anywhere in the world, for any level of government.
